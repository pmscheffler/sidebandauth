# Sideband Authentication via F5 BIG-IP APM

This project is meant to demonstrate sideband authentication functions through leveraging a number of features and functionality within F5's BIG-IP Access Policy Manager (APM).
Per-session and per-request policies are used alongside an iRule and HTTP Connector to perform authentication and validation of traffic destined for an API.
